# mVara Extension Assets

This repository contains public assets for mVara VS Code extensions, such as images and icons used in README files and extension information.

## Purpose

VS Code extension marketplace requires all images in README files to be served from public HTTPS URLs. This repository serves as a centralized location for these assets, allowing our extension code to remain private while ensuring images display correctly in the marketplace.

## Usage

When referencing assets in extension READMEs, use the raw GitHub URL format:

```

```

## Contents
